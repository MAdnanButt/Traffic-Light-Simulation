### Traffic Flow Simulation and Optimization Using AnyLogic  
This repository contains the code and resources for simulating and optimizing urban traffic flow using **AnyLogic**. The project models a real-world traffic scenario with diverse vehicle types (cars, buses, trucks) and integrates 3D elements such as buildings, gas stations, and factories to create a realistic simulation environment.  

#### Features:  
- **Dynamic Traffic Flow Simulation**: Implements road networks with customizable intersections and signal timings.  
- **Agent-Based Modeling**: Utilizes AnyLogic's Road Traffic Library to simulate individual vehicle behavior and traffic dynamics.  
- **Optimization of Traffic Lights**: Adjusts traffic signal timings to minimize vehicle residence time and improve flow efficiency.  
- **3D Visualization**: Enhances the simulation with 3D models for better analysis and presentation.  
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows flexibility in configuring vehicle types, road structures, and traffic light settings.  

#### Use Cases:  
- Urban traffic management and planning.  
- Analysis of traffic congestion and optimization solutions.  
- Simulation-based decision support for smart city projects.  

#### Requirements:  
- AnyLogic (Professional/University Edition).  

#### How to Use:  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the project in AnyLogic.  
3. Customize the parameters, such as vehicle types or signal timings, as needed.  
4. Run the simulation and analyze results for optimization.
